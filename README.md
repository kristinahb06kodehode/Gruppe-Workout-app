# Gruppe-Workout-app

Gruppeoppgave

## About the app:

We have chosen to make an app to log your workouts.
In the app we have input fields stacked under eachother for Exercise, where you can write which exercise you've done, then theres two iput fields beside where you can write how many reps you did, and how much weight.

We added a save button, so when you click save the information that you fill into the fields won't disappear, even if you reload the page, unless you click the clear button we have added.

We wanted to make the app more comprehensive and complex, but because of the time limit and some technical problems
we didn't have time for that, so our main focus became making it look good and for the LocalStorage to work.

## Design:

## Colors:

- Background color/Body color: #345830, we chose a green color similar to army green.
  The reasoning is because the army represents discipline and hard-work. The color is also pleasing for the eyes and not to bright.

- Container color/Button color: #48775B, A more muted and lighter green color with a bit of opacity. The opacity is so the svg icon on the background will be shown better, and make it more visually pleasing. The effect of the opacity with the lighter green color makes the app look more like an app as well, instead of just a noteblock with colors.

## Typography and text colors

## Font-family:

Jockey One, we thought it fit the theme of Army and Workout, both the name and the look.

## Text/logo color:

#F1F1F1, Close to completely white, the reason we chose a bright white for the logo text is
because we didn't want the app to be to dark toned, and thought that white fit well with the green colors. The logo
has a brighter white than the rest of the text, so that it really stands out and you know what the app is meant for at once.

## Text color body:

#C6C6C6, muted white/light grey color. We didn't want the text to pop so much through the whole body. We thought it didn't fit the theme of the app and the other colors, so therefore we chose a more muted white instead of bright white. It's easier on the eyes and the phone.

## Text stroke:

#345830, We chose the same green as the body color so the theme will stay the same, and it would look as "completed" and clean as possible. We added the stroke to make the text pop without being bright, make it more readable and look in our opinion a bit better.

## SVG

Workout based icons from iconify that we wanted in the header and on the background. These to make the app look a bit more fun and give you a "boost" by looking at them.
